\title{Hash Names Consistently for Privacy-Aware Matching}
\usage{
hash_name_consistently(
  names,
  salt = "zoomstudentengagement",
  normalize_names = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of names to hash}

\item{salt}{Character string to add to hashes for security (default: package name)}

\item{normalize_names}{Logical, whether to normalize names before hashing (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
Character vector of consistent hashes
}
\description{
Creates consistent hashes for names to enable matching while maintaining privacy.
This function normalizes names and generates deterministic hashes that can be
used for cross-session matching without exposing real names.
}
\examples{
# Basic usage
hash_name_consistently(c("John Smith", "J. Smith", "Smith, John"))

# With normalization (handles variations)
hash_name_consistently(c("Tom", "Thomas", "Tommy"), normalize_names = TRUE)

# Without normalization (exact matching only)
hash_name_consistently(c("Tom", "Thomas", "Tommy"), normalize_names = FALSE)
}
