}
\arguments{
\item{clean_names_df}{A tibble containing session details and summary metrics
by speaker for all class sessions (and placeholders for missing sections),
including customized student names.}

\item{data_folder}{Overall data folder for your recordings and data. Defaults
to 'data'}

\item{section_names_lookup_file}{File name of the csv file of customized
student names by section Defaults to 'section_names_lookup.csv'}
}
\value{
A tibble corresponding to the csv file saved, which is a sorted subset
  of the provided tibble containing session details and summary metrics by
  speaker for all class sessions (and placeholders for missing sections),
  including customized student names.

\description{
This function takes a tibble containing session details and summary metrics
by speaker for all class sessions (and placeholders for missing sections),
including customized student names (`clean_names_df`) and saves a subset as a
csv file with the specified file name (`section_names_lookup_file`) to the
specified data folder (`data_folder`).
