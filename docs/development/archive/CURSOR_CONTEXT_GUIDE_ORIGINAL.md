- Provide development workflow context

### Getting Help

**When Context is Insufficient**:
1. Run both context scripts
2. Check PROJECT.md for current status
3. Review recent GitHub issues
4. Check test and coverage status manually
5. Provide specific error messages or problems

**For Complex Issues**:
1. Include full error messages
2. Provide relevant file contents
3. Include test results
4. Describe expected vs actual behavior
5. Include environment information

## Advanced Context Techniques

### Custom Context Scripts

Create project-specific context scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/my-context.sh

echo "## Custom Context for [Specific Task]"
echo ""
echo "**Current Focus**: [What you're working on]"
echo "**Relevant Files**: [Files involved]"
echo "**Current Issues**: [Specific problems]"
echo "**Expected Outcome**: [What you want to achieve]"
```

### Context Automation

Set up automated context updates:

```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
# Update context before committing
./scripts/context-for-new-chat.sh > .cursor/current-context.txt
```

### Context Integration

Integrate context with development tools:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile
alias context='./scripts/context-for-new-chat.sh'
alias rcontext='Rscript scripts/context-for-new-chat.R'
alias fullcontext='./scripts/context-for-new-chat.sh && Rscript scripts/context-for-new-chat.R'
```
